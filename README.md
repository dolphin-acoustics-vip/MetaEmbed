# MetaEmbed

This program will read a local CSV file, obtain its absolute path and append the CSV with relevant information. The new OneDrive URL contains information like location, species, cruise and encounter - which is embedded into the CSV. Metadata is embedded in the form of preservation metadata compliant with W3C embedded metadata format: http://www.w3.org/TR/tabular-data-model/#embedded-metadata.
