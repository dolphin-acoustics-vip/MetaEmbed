# MetaEmbed

This program will read a local CSV file, obtain the file path (which contains relavent information) and append the CSV with species, location, cruise and encounter information. Metadata is embedded in the form of preservation metadata compliant with W3C embedded metadata format: http://www.w3.org/TR/tabular-data-model/#embedded-metadata
